-what is a commit and what does it consist of? 


## intro
started by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel
show git README
git is a distributed vcs => NO "master server", everyone has the full repository with the whole history (up to the last fetch)


## most used git commands
quickly look at those commands and which commands would be similar

### adding content
add / reset (/ clean) ~ include / exclude
commit ~ checkin
explain: working dir, staging area, repository

### branching
branch ~ branch
checkout ~ checkout (done automatically)
merge / rebase ~ merge back

### working with remotes
fetch doesn't exist
pull ~ get latest
push ~ checkin

### misc
clone ~ doesn't really exist (get latest)
init ~ ? create repository


## git is just a fancy graph manipulator
Show a picture of a git graph like this one:

54f7 <-- db03 <-- ???? <-- ????
  \-- ???? <-- ????-/

Quickly explain HEAD as "the last commit you are currently basing on".
When using commit you just write the content of the staging area into a new commit which references the current HEAD as its parent.
Commit is the "only" party manipulating this graph (only adding)
Everyone else will only manipulate some pointers to the commits (like a branch creates a new ref or checkout moves the HEAD)
